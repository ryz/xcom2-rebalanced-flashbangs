# Rebalanced Flashbangs - XCOM 2 Mod
An XCOM 2 mod which rebalances the flashbang grenades.

Flashbang grenades have a reduced radius, they hit your own soldiers now, deal one point of damage per default AND have a small chance to additonally stun any unit in the AoE.

Balancing values are exposed and can be adjusted in the corresponding .ini files.

**LW2 Compatibilty untested**, probably does not work.
